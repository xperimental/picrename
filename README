picrename is a simple renaming utility for batch-renaming many files.

The tool was created with a certain name structure in mind, so most of the time flexibility was
traded for fast development.

picrename currently produces filenames with the following structure:
  [PREFIX]_[ID]_[DESCRIPTION].[EXTENSION]

Where the description can be chosen for all files independently and prefix is a global option for
all files in the batch process. The ID field is a number generated by the application, which can be
modified by the user. The extension is the only field, which will be copied directly from the source
file name.
